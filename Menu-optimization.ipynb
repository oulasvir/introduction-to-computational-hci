    "### Optimization: A formalism for generating and adapting user interface designs \n",
    "\n",
    "*Optimization* refers to both the **outcome** (optimal design) and the **process** of systematically improving a design. User interface design, then, is algorithmic combination of discrete design decisions to obtain an optimal solution defined by an objective function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model-based combinatorial optimization** invites contributions from computer scientists, designers, and behavioral scientists. Three types of problems define the approach:\n",
    "1. Modeling: Representations of design problem and knowledge in code\n",
    "2. Inference: Inference of parameters of that model that best describe the designer's or users' goals.\n",
    "3. Search: Algorithmically searchign for best solutions to the obtained problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial optimization can be used not only to find an optimal design but to *assist a designer in various problems encountered in design*, such as:\n",
    "* a unique (maximally different but equally good) solution\n",
    "* a design that strikes the best compromise among competing objectives\n",
    "* a design that is robust to changes in assumptions (e.g., about conditions of use or users)\n",
    "* a design achieved by minimal changes to a current design\n",
    "* a design that is within some k% from the present design. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges \n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial optimization is a principled approach that insists on rigorous definitions of the design task and objectives. Be warned about:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ramp-up costs: Formal definition and development of search methods can be laborious and risky;\n",
    "2. At times exceedingly hard problems: While modest background in computer science suffices for first probes, real-world cases can be prohibitively hard and insist on professional support;\n",
    "3. Knowledge gap: Defining meaningful objective functions (e.g., aesthetics, learnability) may require support from a cognitive or behavioral scientist with mathematical abilities."

    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A **design task** consists of three elements:\n",
    "1. **design space**: a finite set of alternative designs (search space; a.k.a. feasible set, candidate set); \n",
    "2. **objective function**: defines what is meant by 'good' or 'desirable' design;\n",
    "3. **task instance**: sets task-specific parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A task defined like this can then be attacked by a **solver**. It goes through the design space to find increasingly better designs. We use this structure in the following exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/overview.png\" width=\"95%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design task\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain words, the task is to find the design that yields the highest value of a given objective (goodness) function. The following definition makes **the combinatorial structure of design** more explicit:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Find } \\mathbf{x} =\n",
    "\t\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "\tx_1 \\\\\n",
    "\tx_2 \\\\\n",
    "\t\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "\tx_n\n",
    "\t\\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbf{X}\n",
    "\\mbox{ which maximizes } f(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "where \n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}$ is an *n*-dimensional **design vector**,  each dimension describing a **design variable**, and\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{X}$ is **the set of feasible designs** (all vectors that fulfill constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain words, a design is a vector in a multi-dimensional vector space. The objective function assigns each vector a value describing its goodness (or badness). When we optimize, we are looking for the vectors that obtain the highest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design space\n",
    "\n",
    "A design space is the product of design variables under consideration. In a real design problem, some variables are fixed and some are open and to be decided by an optimizer. **A design variable** captures a decision using familiar types of variables, such as:\n",
    "* boolean (e.g., Do we offer auditory feedback for button press or not?)\n",
    "* integer (e.g., position of an element on x-axis)\n",
    "* real (e.g., hue)\n",
    "* categorical (e.g., type of an element).\n",
    "\n",
    "In combinatorial optimization continuous variables are discretized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional and other requirements that 'rule out' candidate designs are collectively called **design constraints**. Example: When designing a Web layout, we should not place elements such that they overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimating problem size\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a design space allows examining its size and structure. **Search spaces in user interface design are often very large**. For example, for $n$ functionality there are $2^n - 1$ ways to combine them to an application, which for only 50 functions means 1,125,899,906,842,623 possibilities. Further, assuming that 50 have been selected, they can be organized into a hierarhical menu in $100! \\approx 10^{158}$ ways. [Combinatorics](https://www.tug.org/texshowcase/cheat.pdf) can be used to analyze problem sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function $f( \\mathbf{x} )$ states what you believe makes a design good. It is a function that assigns an **objective score (or value)** to each design candidate. The design candidate that obtains the highest (or lowest, when minimizing) score is the **optimum design**. The function can be about anything regarded desirable, such as surface features of the interface (e.g., minimal white space) or expected performance of users (e.g., 'task A should be completed as quickly as possible') and so on. In HCI, the quality of a interface is primarily determined by reference to end-users, for example user performance and experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many principled (and unprincipled) ways to obtain objective functions:\n",
    "* Literature: A model or theory from prior work\n",
    "* Data-driven approach: Use e.g. statistics or machine learning to obtain a model from data\n",
    "* Standards, guidelines, and design patterns\n",
    "* Heuristics, such as guidelines and best-found practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "After a task has been defined, a solver should be chosen and tuned to attack its instances. We will later look at solvers and their different properties. The process of 'solving' can be intuitively understood as search for highest peaks (when maximizing), or lowest valleys (when minimizing), in a vast 'landscape':\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "To say that a design is optimal is to say that in the defined set of candidate designs, there is no better design (global optimum has been identified). A design is **globally optimal** when the search method *guarantees* that it achieves the highest objective value in the whole design space. Such guarantees are offered by exhaustive search and exact methods (e.g., integer programming). When we do not have access to those methods, for example because the complexity of the objective function, we cannot claim global optimality. A design is **approximately optimal** when its objective value is within some margin of the optimal design, or when there is a good chance that only marginally better designs exist.</div>\n",

    "### Design space: Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "*Design space* is a representation of the candidate set of designs, laid out in a suitable format for some chosen search algorithm. [Some representations are illustrated here](imgs/representations.png). The choice of representation affects:\n",
    "* availability of sovers; for example, the formulation of the concept of search neighborhood, which is exploited in local search methods\n",
    "* computational efficiency\n",

Moreover, to be relevant in interaction design, this function should quantify an aspect like usability, enjoyability, ergonomics, or errors. Several objectives may need to be combined for reasonable results. This table shows 11 examples spanning task, cognitive, motor, and aesthetic aspects:\n",

    "**Subjective goals and preferences** can be dealt with by two main means: (1) by calibrating weights manually to correspond to some distribution of preferences, be they designers' or users'; (2) using machine learning to parametrize models to best correspond with individual priorities expressed in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approaches to defining objective functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristics** are rules of thumb used in design,  such as 'white space should be minimized'.  Since most heuristics are 'weak' (carry little information), multiple are needed. This leads to the problem of **conflict resolution**: how to weigh the contribution of one heuristic against another. Another issue of heuristics is their questionable validity. (Note: not to be confused with heuristic optimization methods.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics** are expressed as a real-valued functions that capture some feature of a design and link it to predictions of outcomes to users. Example: Overplotting metrics in the design of information visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression** offers a more expressive yet quickly computable mathematical form of cost functions:\n",
    "$y = f (\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{\\beta} ) + \\epsilon$ . \n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulator-based models** are step-wise executed functions $M$ that map the model parameters $\\theta$ to data. In HCI, the parameters $\\theta$ capture both parameters of the user and those of the task or context. Simulators are **generative models** that predict not only the outcomes of interaction but intermediate steps, or the process of interaction. A simulator may address multiple design objectives in a coherent manner that require less weight-tuning. However, they are non-linear and significantly more expensive to execute, ruling out exact methods (e.g, integer programming).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Task instance\n",

    "* Which elements are to be decided (sizes, colors etc)?\n",

    "* Properties of targeted user groups, such as goals, capabilities, and interaction styles of users (e.g., what do they want to achieve with the interface?)\n",
    "* Constraints of the interface (e.g., screen resolution, input method).\n",

    "\n",
    "Modern methods in combinatorial optimization can be divided into two main classes:\n",
    "1. **Black-box or heuristic methods** do not necessitate assumptions about  the objective function, but rather consider it as a black-box -- like an oracle -- that tells them the objective value of a given candidate it has generated.  \n",
    "2. **Exact methods** such as integer programming offer mathematical guarantees for solutions but insist on analysis of the objective function for revealing simplifications and links to known tasks in the optimization literature. Integer programming is covered in the other part of the day."

    "\n",
    "**Local search** relies on a definition of a **neighborhood** of a given design. For example, the neighboring layouts of a keyboard layouts are those that can be constructed by swapping a pair of letters. Starting from an initial configuration, local search proceeds by chosing a neighboring configuration with an objective value that is at least as good as the current one. These choices could be, for example, greedy or randomized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulated Annealing** exploits local and random search in a exploration/exploitation scheme. A neighboring configuration is not only chosen when it yields to a better objective value but also with a certain probability when it is worse. However, this probability decreases with the extent of the detoriation of the objective value (temperature). \n",
